# HCIM Tracker Twitter Bot

This is the code for the Twitter bot currently running @ https://twitter.com/PVPHCIM_tracker

## Setup

Fork this repo if you'd like the contribute

```bash
1. Install dependencies
$ yarn

2. Copy environment variables and fill out with your own Twitter information
$ cp .env.example .env

3. Run the project
$ yarn dev
```

Notes:

This wont work without going in and taking the Twitter portions out, or providing your own Twitter account keys as outlined in the `.env.example` file. Feel free to just take that stuff out and then log what you were going to tweet.

Simple as that, open to contributions - just open a PR and DM me
This project also costs money to keep alive and run, so if you're feeling kind DM me to chuck me some money for server costs
